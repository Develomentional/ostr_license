## Open Security Tool & Research License (OSTR License)

The *Open Security Tool & Research license* is a Open Source license, based directly on the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), with the addition of a disclaimer at the end. The goal of the disclaimer is to establish "dual use" status, and warn end users that use without authorization may be illegal.

At this point, this license is a proposal to the community, to determine suitability, and usefulness. The goal is to define a standard, open, interoperable license that addresses the unique needs and concerns of the security community.

###FAQs

**Will this keep me from violating the [Wassenaar Arrangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassenaar_Arrangement), ยง202c StGB, CFAA, etc.?**
No. It's up to you to make sure that you don't violate export restrictions, or other laws. This license just adds a disclaimer to try to make sure that the end user understands that they are responsible for their actions, and to state intentions, to help establish dual use status.

**Does this guarantee dual use status?**
No. Defining what is and isn't dual use depends on varying definitions and laws; this *might* help meet a specific definition, though it's up to courts to determine what is and isn't dual use on a case by case basis.

**Why do this?**
This was inspired by a number of conversations, but the most recent that prodded me to do it is [this conversation](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Apr/60) on the Full Disclosure mailing list.

**What are you promising this will give me?**
Nothing. If you want to know how exactly this will effect you, or if your project will be considered dual use, contact your attorney.
